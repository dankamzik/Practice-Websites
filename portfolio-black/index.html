        The perfect blend between utility and beauty is not easy to achieve.
        Time, care, skill and ingenuity must come together to create a sum larger than it's parts.
        When this occurs, a creator has broken into the realm of elegance; a perfect blending of grace and functionality that is more than just a website.
        It is a virtual avatar of the mind, a pure expression of human thought and agency. This is what I strive to achieve. This is what I create.
